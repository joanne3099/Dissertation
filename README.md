# Dissertation

This directory contains two different python scripts and two different R scripts used for my dissertation. 
The human-duration script works for the hand-annotated text grids that were included in my bachelor project, whilst the maus-duration script refers to the webmaus-generated text grids.
The R scripts are for comparing the human and computer generated outputs.
